<h1 className="text-4xl mb-8">From Silos to Synergy</h1>

<p>A Top 10 pharmaceutical company needed to align multiple global brand teams under a unified therapeutic area strategy—something never attempted in their organization. The barrier wasn't capability but entrenched thinking patterns that positioned teams as competitors rather than collaborators. They needed help cutting through these mental barriers to see solutions hidden in plain sight.</p>

<h2 className="text-2xl mt-12 mb-2">The Challenge Ahead</h2>

<p className="mb-2">As we worked with them to develop their therapeutic area strategy, three critical challenges emerged:</p>

<ul>
  {[
    "Brand teams operated independently—challenging this fundamental assumption, not just combining plans, was the real issue.",
    "Competing priorities across imminent launches and product lifecycle transitions created tension between immediate market demands and future growth planning, forcing difficult resource trade-offs.",
    "Strategy required alignment across global functions, regional markets, and stakeholders in three high-profile disease areas."

</ul>

<h2 className="text-2xl mt-12 mb-2">How We Helped</h2>

<p className="mb-2">We transformed complex problems into actionable solutions by:</p>

<ul>
  {[
    "Mapping the conversational terrain before diving in, helping leaders identify the true north of their collaboration before navigating sensitive cross-functional discussions.",
    "Supporting decision making about how a portfolio strategy would actually make them more competitive, and what the implications looked like at the brand and indication level.",
    "Distilling complex strategic choices into a clear narrative that answered fundamental questions for a very senior audience."
