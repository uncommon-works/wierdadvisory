<h1 className="text-4xl mb-8">AI Vision to Execution</h1>

<p>Transforming AI strategy from theory to reality isn't just about good planningâ€”it's about navigating unexpected challenges while keeping teams aligned. That's where we found ourselves with a high-growth enterprise software company. They had a clear vision for AI and strong technical talent but struggled with execution. What they needed was help turning plans into reality. </p>

    "Customer expectations evolved while competitors made moves, requiring stakeholders to have difficult conversations about changing priorities."
